The funniest part is when people add .env files with secrets to .gitignore - but then still include them in the appâ€™s assets (adding inside asset folder and then including them inside pubspec.yaml). And to make it worse, the app is also being built for the web.

Thatâ€™s exactly why using "--dart-define" and structured env files is the safer approach. If you ever decide to build a web version of your app in the future, having secrets exposed in the assets could become a serious security risk. Keeping config values outside the source and passing them at build time is the right way to go.


for running app in dev mode:

    flutter run --dart-define-from-file=env/dev.json

for running app in prod mode:

    flutter run --release --dart-define-from-file=env/prod.json


or you can add to your Android Studio or VS code this additional run args:

    --dart-define-from-file=env/prod.json


building releases:

    flutter build <platform> --dart-define-from-file=env/prod.json

platforms: apk, appbundle, ios, ipa, windows, linux, macos
